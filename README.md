# extract_marcxml_for_argot_unc
UNC's script to extract MARC-XML from Sierra ILS, for submission to Traject for translation into Argot

- Shared here because Duke may find it (or part of it) useful
- Uses MARC-XML to avoid record-length limits of MARC binary, which we would hit with some of the bibs that have many attached items, holdings, and/or order records (mainly items)
